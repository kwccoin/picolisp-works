The source-code of the free book "PicoLisp Works"

PicoLisp Works is a compilation of (almost) all available information
about the technological gem PicoLisp - a programming language and
environment that definitely deserves wider attention.

Built on the unique characteristics of Lisp (almost no syntax, code is
equivalent to data), PicoLisp combines powerful abstractions with
simplicity and purity.

In a software world that is driven by hypes and desillusions, a
language like PicoLisp almost appears as timeless as mathematics. With
its roots in the very beginning of programming language development
(Lisp was, together with Fortran, among the very first of its kind),
PicoLisp may well represent the future too - as a candidate for being
the "hundred-year language", that all programming languages finally
converge into. 

"PicoLisp Works" is accompanied by a second volume, "PicoLisp by
Example", (https://github.com/tj64/picolisp-by-example) with more than
600 PicoLisp solutions to a wide range of programming tasks as well as
the full PicoLisp function reference. Both volumes are freely
available as pdf files, e.g. on Scribd (scribd.com).

Both books are published under the GNU Free Documentation Licence.
