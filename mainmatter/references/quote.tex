  This article discusses how it's unique implementation of the
  \texttt{quote} function makes PicoLisp more efficient than other
  Lisp's in terms of both space and time.

\section{Even small details make a difference!}
\label{sec:quote-small-details}

In Lisp, the single quote character plays a central role. It is actually a
\textit{read macro}, which expands to the built-in function \texttt{quote}. Its purpose is
to inhibit the evaluation of the following argument, and \texttt{quote} is one of the
most often called functions.

But it is remarkable that almost all Lisp implementations handle this in a
somewhat suboptimal way. They define \texttt{quote} to return its \textit{first} argument,
without evaluating it. So far so good. But when you think about that for a
moment, you may ask: ``Why only the first argument?''

This is inefficient, both in terms of space and time, and has no benefit at all.
Yet almost all Lisp implementations stick to it.

PicoLisp breaks with that bad habit, and defines \texttt{quote} to return \textit{all}
arguments, without evaluating them.

Let's look at some examples: Quoted expressions like
\begin{wideverbatim}
   'a
   '(a b)
   '(a . x)
\end{wideverbatim}

expand in traditional Lisps to
\begin{wideverbatim}
   (quote a)
   (quote (a b))
   (quote (a . x))
\end{wideverbatim}

while in PicoLisp, they expand to
\begin{wideverbatim}
   (quote . a)
   (quote a b)
   (quote a . x)
\end{wideverbatim}

This makes quite a difference, as it uses only half the space (two cells in
traditional Lisp, but only one in PicoLisp):
\begin{wideverbatim}
   (quote a)
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
      | quote |   ----+----> |   a   |  NIL  |
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+

   (quote . a)
      +-------+-------+
      | quote |   a   |
      +-------+-------+
\end{wideverbatim}

\begin{wideverbatim}
   (quote (a b))
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
      | quote |   ----+----> |   |   |  NIL  |
      +-------+-------+      +---+---+-------+
                                 |
                                 V
                             +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
                             |   a   |   ----+----> |   b   |  NIL  |
                             +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+

   (quote a b)
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
      | quote |   ----+----> |   a   |   ----+----> |   b   |  NIL  |
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
\end{wideverbatim}

\begin{wideverbatim}
   (quote (a . x))
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
      | quote |   ----+----> |   |   |  NIL  |
      +-------+-------+      +---+---+-------+
                                 |
                                 V
                             +-------+-------+
                             |   a   |   x   |
                             +-------+-------+

   (quote a . x)
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
      | quote |   ----+----> |   a   |   x   |
      +-------+-------+      +-------+-------+
\end{wideverbatim}

The runtime code for a traditional \texttt{quote} has more work to do. It needs two
pointer dereferences to get the data, while PicoLisp needs only one.

For that reason, \texttt{quote} is the shortest of all functions in PicoLisp, being
\begin{wideverbatim}
   any doQuote(any x) {return cdr(x);}
\end{wideverbatim}

in \texttt{C}, or
\begin{wideverbatim}
   (code 'doQuote 2)
      ld E (E CDR)  # Get CDR
      ret
\end{wideverbatim}

in \texttt{asm}.
